# Home DMC Controll

is a simple arduino based DMX controller to controll led lights installed in your home.

## Idea

The selection for the lighting scene in daily use should be as simple as possible. Therefore exactly two push buttons are used to move up and down in a list of lighting scenes. Since I am not a fan of idle transformers, a conventional light switch is used in my application to switch the whole system on and off. In the same way a corresponding scene could be set.

The individual scenes should be adjustable directly on the controller without additional hardware. The input of the scenes works like on lighting control desks without motor faders via potentiometer and buttons. To make the firmware easy (without programmer and co) and maintainable by everyone, an Arduino was used, because it has a USB converter and the IDE is easy to use and install.
